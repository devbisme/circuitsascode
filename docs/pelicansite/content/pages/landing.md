Title: A Library of Circuits, Expressed as Code
save_as: index.html

This is a companion to the [SKiDL site](http://xesscorp.github.io/skidl).
SKiDL lets you create electronic circuits by writing Python scripts instead of using a schematic editor.
While describing your circuitry using code has many advantages, it's not a familiar method
to most electronics designers.

This site hosts a library of pre-built circuits that will help you get started with SKiDL
in two ways:

1. It provides a set of lower-level modules that you can integrate within your own designs.
2. It shows you examples of how to write SKiDL code.

Just click on the [Library](/api/html/index.html) menu item to start browsing the collection of circuits.
