&lt;p&gt;Not much, you say? I agree. But other things were happening.
While doing the R-2R DAC, I discovered a problem with how SKiDL handled interfaces.
(That's one of the reasons I started circuitsascode: to help me test and debug SKiDL.)
Correcting that bug caused another problem to appear with packages and I had to fix &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.
If that wasn't enough, I decided to move the SKiDL blog from the Jekyll static-site generator to Pelican
and then finally get the Sphinx documentation properly formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I re-wrote the new and existing circuit modules to make it easier
for a user to modify the circuits that get generated.
I'll discuss how circuitsascode modules are structured in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not a lot appears to have happened, but progress continues under the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry><entry><title>Why?</title><link href="/circuitsascode/why-this-site-2021-08-20.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-20T16:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-20T16:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dave Vandenbout</name></author><id>tag:None,2021-08-20:/circuitsascode/why-this-site-2021-08-20.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why does &lt;em&gt;Circuits as Code&lt;/em&gt; exist?

&lt;p&gt;Yes, maybe. But "circuits as code" is so much easier to remember.

&lt;p&gt;This library and the web site also serve some other purposes.
Most importantly, it contains useful subcircuits that you can
include in your own designs to save yourself some effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also a teaching resource where you can read through the source code to see
how SKiDL is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it serves as a testbed for SKiDL.
If I'm creating a subcircuit and it's getting complicated,
that indicates I may need to add some new feature to SKiDL.
And if I run into errors errors along the way,
then that helps debug SKiDL itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a lot in this library right now, but that will change over time.
Adding a new subcircuit doesn't require a big time investment.
And if you have any subcircuits of your own, please submit a pull request to
add them to this library.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry></feed>
