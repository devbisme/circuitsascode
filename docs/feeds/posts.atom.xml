&lt;p&gt;Yes, maybe. But "circuits as code" is so much easier to remember.
Nobody knows what "SKiDL" means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This library and the web site also serve some other purposes.
Most importantly, it contains useful subcircuits that you can
include in your own designs to save yourself some effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also a teaching resource where you can read through the source code to see
how SKiDL is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it serves as a testbed for SKiDL.
If I'm creating a subcircuit and it's getting complicated,
that indicates I may need to add some new feature to SKiDL.
And if I run into errors errors along the way,
then that helps debug SKiDL itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a lot in this library right now, but that will change over time.
Adding a new subcircuit doesn't require a big time investment.
And if you have any subcircuits of your own, please submit a pull request to
add them to this library.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry></feed>
