def vga(rgb=None, e_series="E12", logic_lvl=3.3 * units.volts):
    """Analog-RGB VGA port driven by red, grn, blu digital color buses.

    Takes list of red, green and blue bus widths and creates a resistor network
    to convert the digital color buses to analog RGB signals that are output
    through a DB-15 connector.

    Args:
        rgb (list, optional): List of integer widths for the red, green and blue buses. Defaults to (3, 3, 3).
        e_series (str, optional): E-series of resistor values (E3, E6, E12, E24, E48, E96, E192). Defaults to "E12" (10%).
        logic_lvl (float, optional): V_hi voltage for digital signals. Defaults to 3.3V.

    Returns:
        Interface:
        An Interface object containing the following I/O
            * red:   Input bus for red component.
            * grn:   Input bus for green component.
            * blu:   Input bus for blue component.
            * hsync: Output net for horizontal sync.
            * vsync: Output net for vertical sync.
            * gnd:   Ground net.

    Example:
        >>> from circuitsascode.displays.vga import *
        >>> red, grn, blu = Bus(5), Bus(4), Bus(3)
        >>> hsync, vsync, gnd = Net(), Net(), Net()
